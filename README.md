# FPE with Nodejs

Format Preserving Encryption backend with Nodejs.

**FPE**: encrypting in such a way that the output (the ciphertext) is in the same format as the input (the plaintext).

FPE attempts to simplify the transition process by preserving the formatting and length of the original data, allowing a drop-in replacement of plaintext values with their ciphertexts in legacy applications [1].

## Usage

Refer to [samples](./test_endpoints.sh).
